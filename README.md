# Monumental Android Application
Monumental is an Android Application written by Jan-Willem van Bremen
## Intro
More and more people go on far away ventures to foreign countries to see the world. But traveling is expensive and a lot to organize. Because of that many people travel without a dedicated guide to show them around and give information about the local Landmarks wherever they might be visiting. They are left handling tourist booklets offering outdated information on top of being a hassle to carry around and consult.

The vision for the Monumental Android application is to give tourists anywhere in the world that travel without a guide the ability to get information about Landmarks by taking a picture of it. Next to that users are able to keep track of what Landmarks they have visited and add them to their Journey. That way when users are done with their Journey they are able look back at all the Landmarks they visited.

Within the application a user is able to take a picture using a live camera preview or choose an existing picture from the phone’s storage. When a picture is taken or chosen the application quickly gives a response if one or more Landmarks have been detected in the image. If one or more Landmarks are detected in the image the application allows the user to view a list of the names of the Landmarks. Users also have the ability to gather more information about the found Landmark(s) by performing a search for it from within the application.
